Drowsiness Detection System

This project is a real-time drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pygame. It leverages MediaPipeâ€™s Face Mesh model to identify key facial landmarks, especially around the eyes, and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), a well-known metric to determine eye closure.

When the EAR drops below a certain threshold (default: 0.25) for a sustained duration (e.g., 3 seconds), the system detects drowsiness. In response, it triggers a continuous beep sound using Pygame and sends an email alert to a specified recipient. To avoid spamming, the system enforces a cooldown period between email alerts.

The main window displays the webcam feed along with real-time landmark tracking and alert messages. In parallel, a secondary analysis window shows zoomed-in facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) on a black canvas and includes a live EAR graph for better monitoring. The landmarks and graph disappear in real-time when no face is detected to ensure clarity.

This solution is well-suited for driver monitoring systems, student engagement tracking, or workplace fatigue detection. It provides a compact and efficient setup that integrates computer vision with real-time alerts and analysis.

Usage

Ensure all dependencies are installed.

Replace the email credentials and recipient in the send_email() function.

Run the script using a webcam-connected device.

Press q to quit the application.

For best results, use in well-lit environments with a clear frontal view of the face.
